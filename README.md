# Conventions

This project is started small, and do not turn down any kind of improvement as long as enough votes are present for it.

Initial proposed components:

- An incremental crawler in nodejs
- A web UI for basic reading and full-text search


Future components:

- helper functions for NLP analysis on the dataset (in python as you data guys like?)


## Coding

### NodeJS

#### Package Manager

prefer (yarn)[https://yarnpkg.com] as a default package manager, which is nice and neat

#### Coding Style

- stick to ES6
- 2 space indentation
- no ending semicolons unless you will die otherwise
- prefer Promise/await/async to callbacks


### Python

- stick to Python3
